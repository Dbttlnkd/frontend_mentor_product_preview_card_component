## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first design on HTML/CSS for which I had the opportunity to learn about Flexbox.

I had some difficulties on making sure the cart SVG was fully centered on height and I did not succeed with using a ```html <button>``` and ```css::before.```.

I corrected the issue with using ```html <a href"">``` instead. Not sure if this is the best way.
